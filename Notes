// Entity framework is an object relational mapper(ORM) that enables .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects.
// it eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write.

// An Object-relational mapper provides an object-oriented layer between relational databases and object-oriented programming languages 
//without having to write SQL queries. It standardixes interfaces reducing boilerplates and speeding development time.
